udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist program -  project3

This project will use the .csv data files in folder "data": articles_community.csv and user-item-interactions.csv which contain the information about the articles and the interactions of users with articles.

And it requires the following packages to run the project: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. The package pickle may be used for the extra part (Part IV).

Part I will give you the Exploratory Data Analysis about articles and interactions of users with articles like how many articles a user interacts with and the visual and descriptive statistics about the number of times each user interacts with an article, etc.

Part II will calculate the ranking like the n top articles ordered with most interactions.

Part III will form the the user-item matrix to give the recommendations based on user-user based collaborative filtering.
